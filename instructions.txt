*** RESTFactory ***

1) Get client_id and client_secret from Google (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and
    compile the config.json file with the information about the models you want to expose,
     the permissions and the base URL that hosts the APIs.

2) Run 'run_restfactory_main.sh' with the path and filename of json to use
    or with the only one available parameter "-r" ("--reset") like:

            ./run_restfactory_main.sh config.json

            ./run_restfactory_main.sh -r

3) Your Django app is now built and configured, so you can include it in your Django project,
    use it as a startup, or just play around with it:

            for example: python manage.py runserver 8000

4) You can create a new admin for all applications with

            python manage.py createadmin

    You only need to enter email

    Or you can assign an admin role for specific apps, for example

            python manage.py createadmin filmes

5) You can generate openApi spec with /schema, and navigate throw it with /docs
