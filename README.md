# RESTFactory
This project presents a solution for rapid development of REST APIs in Django using dynamically generated applications. The proposed approach uses a configuration file and a Python script to generate Django apps with the necessary models, serializers and views for CRUD operations. The resulting apps can be easily integrated into a Django project, providing developers with a scalable and efficient way to handle API development, or it can be use for educational reason. In addition, these apps come with built-in authentication and authorization functionalities, allowing for the quick creation of secure REST APIs with minimal effort.
